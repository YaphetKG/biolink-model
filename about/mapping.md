# Mapping to a graph store

BioLink Model aims to be a datamodel that can bridge the gap between how knowledge is represented in property graphs and triple stores.

While the model itself, is graph store agnostic - implementing BioLink Model for a technology of your choice involves a few nuances. 

Such nuances are addressed below with recommendations on what is the standard way of representing nodes and edges that is BioLink Model compliant.
